Demo of App Running:

  Here, I am not attaching demo of app running because i dont have any physical iphone. And this App requires a physical device to scan the QR code.
  Code contains zero compiler erros. And i am very sure that this will work as per the requirements.
  Therefore i hereby request ios development team to run this repository on a physical device and check its running state.
